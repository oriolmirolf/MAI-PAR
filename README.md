# Planning and Approximate Reasoning (PAR) Repository

This repository contains the work completed for the course **Planning and Approximate Reasoning (PAR)**, part of the **Master in Artificial Intelligence** program at **UPC, UB, and URV**. The course, taught at **URV**, explores planning techniques and reasoning under uncertainty, applied to real-world-inspired scenarios.

## Teammates
The following teammates collaborated on all practical exercises:

## Practicals

### **Practice 1: Rescue Drone Task**
Developed a PDDL-based planner for a rescue drone to navigate a disaster site, rescue stranded individuals, and deliver them to a safe zone while avoiding obstacles and adhering to capacity constraints. The focus was on optimizing actions for minimal energy consumption and providing detailed analysis of planning outcomes.

### **Practice 2: Robot Chef Task**
Implemented a PDDL planner for a robot chef in a Japanese restaurant. The robot navigates a structured kitchen, gathers ingredients, prepares dishes, cleans tools, and plates meals for delivery. The planner handled constraints such as one-item carrying capacity and adjacency-based movement, with scenarios increasing in complexity.

### **Practice 3: Fuzzy Expert System for Phishing Detection**
Designed a fuzzy expert system in MATLAB to classify websites into phishing risk categories. The system utilized linguistic variables, a rule-based approach, and defuzzification to provide both risk scores and classification. The practical included system validation and advanced design proposals.
